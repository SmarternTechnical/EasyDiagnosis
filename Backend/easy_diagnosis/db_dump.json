However, most prominently, it is a health supplement required for building and maintaining healthy bones and teeth. Our bones are calcium reservoirs of our body and get continuously used for performing various body functions. Calcium is very important for maintaining the balance between breaking down and building up of bones, especially in certain conditions like arthritis where the bone destruction exceeds the bone formation. It also supports flexible movements and mobility and reduces stiffness.Vitamin D3: It plays a very crucial role in protecting your bones by helping your body absorb calcium and by supporting your muscles. It enhances the absorption of calcium and phosphorous from the intestine, which is critical for the strength of bone and teeth. If you don’t get enough vitamin D, you are more likely to experience fractures, muscle pain, weakness. It reduces the risk of osteoporosis, a condition of weak bones and due to its role in immune modulation, it helps relieve pain associated with arthritis.Zinc: Zinc is an essential mineral involved in numerous aspects of cellular function and metabolic activities. Zinc supports normal growth and development, supports immune function, wound healing and is essentially required for the maintenance of healthy bones, joints and teeth. It stimulates bone formation and inhibits bone resorption, thereby increasing bone mass. It has preventive effects on bone loss induced in various conditions like arthritis.Magnesium: It is an essential mineral that regulates diverse biochemical reactions in the body like energy production, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control and blood pressure. Magnesium is required for the structural development of bone and is involved in bone formation and influences the activities of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone crucial for bone function. It has anti-inflammatory actions which help relieve pain and discomfort in arthritis and supports antioxidant action, thus protects joints and bones from oxidative damage. It improves flexibility and mobility of joints.Cissus Quadrangularis: It is also known as “Bone Setter”. It has antioxidant, bone healing, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It helps to increase the healing process of bones. It is very useful in conditions like osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

How soon can Prega news detect Pregnancy?Ans: It takes approximately 5 minutes for the Prega News Pregnancy test kit to confirm a pregnancy.

Then gently pour these 3 drops into the Sample Well of the testing device and wait 5 minutes for the results to show.Q10. What is C and T in Prega News?Ans: The C line is known as the Control line which is an indicator that the test has worked properly, while the T line or Test line is the indication of a positive result provided by the test. In case you do not see the C line, it could mean that the test has not worked and you will need to retake it. However, if you see the C line but do not see the T line, it means the test has worked and that you are not pregnant. On the other hand, if you see both the C and the T line, then it means the test has worked and also that you are pregnant. In the rare case that you see the T line but not the C line, it means that the device may be faulty.Q11. Is it safe to use Prega News Pregnancy Test?Ans. Yes, it is totally safe to use the Prega News Pregnancy Test. It is a test kit that requires a few drops of urine for testing and does not require any invasive procedure.Q12.

What is the best time to take a pregnancy test?Ans. One should preferably take the test using the first-morning sample of urine. This is because your urine in the morning contains more concentration of the pregnancy hormone, which helps in detecting if you are pregnant. Make sure that even if you are taking the pregnancy test at any other time during the day, you must store the urine in the urinary bladder for about 2-4 hrs. This helps in increasing the concentration of pregnancy hormones in the urine.Q14. If my pregnancy test result comes negative the first time, should I re-test?Ans. In case you get a negative pregnancy test result the first time, you are advised to repeat the test again the next morning with fresh urine.Q15. Is the Prega News Pregnancy Test Kit reusable?Ans.

To scale down the inadvertent consumption of microplastics, you can switch from plastic water bottles to one made of copper. LivEasy Essentials has tapped into ancient Ayurvedic knowledge to craft special copper bottles. To give your health an extra shield of protection, you may consider buying LivEasy Essentials Copper Bottle 950 ml.\nKey Features:\n\nComes in a useful size capable of containing 950 ml\nMade from pure, unadulterated and food-grade copper that is free from BPA. Completely non-toxic and safe for usage by children and the elderly.\nThe airtight bottle is also leak and spill-proof.\nFunctional yet aesthetically pleasing design\n\nKey Benefits:\n\nWhen water is stored in a copper bottle for several hours or overnight, copper ions can be leached into the water. Water stored in copper containers has been known to possess antibacterial properties for ages.\nCopper’s anti-inflammatory properties might help people with joint pain and swelling, making it beneficial for those dealing with arthritis or similar conditions.\nWater imbibed with copper ions is believed to boost metabolism, which could help with weight management over time.\nCopper-infused water may help balance the body's pH levels, reducing acidity and promoting better overall health.\nCopper-rich water is known to stimulate peristalsis (the rhythmic contraction of the stomach lining) and this may help with the absorption of nutrients, promoting better health.\nWater stored in this bottle can also help increase the cell turnover of your skin and this may assist in giving you clear and glowing skin.\nPeople with some times of anaemia or low haemoglobin count can also use this bottle because copper-rich water helps in the absorption of iron.\n\nSafety Instructions:\n\nDo not store acidic liquids like lemon juice, vinegar, or fruit juices in this copper bottle. The acid can react with copper, leading to the release of toxic copper salts.\nDon’t overconsume copper-infused water. Drinking 2-3 glasses of copper-infused water per day is generally considered safe. Excessive intake of copper can lead to copper toxicity, which can cause nausea, vomiting, and other health issues.\nClean the copper bottle regularly, at least once a week, to prevent the buildup of harmful substances. Use salt or a mild detergent to clean it. Avoid harsh chemicals as they can erode the copper.\nIf your copper bottle starts showing signs of corrosion or there's a metallic taste in the water stored in it, it may be time to replace it. Damaged or corroded copper can lead to contamination.\nPeople who have been advised of copper restriction should not use this bottle.\n\nFAQs:\nQ1: Can I put hot water in my LivEasy Essentials Copper Bottle?\nAns: It's not recommended to put hot water in a copper bottle. Copper can react with hot liquids, which might alter the taste of the water and lead to the release of unwanted copper ions.\nQ2: Will my LivEasy Essentials Copper Bottle turn green eventually?\nAns: Yes, copper can develop a greenish patina over time due to oxidation. This is not harmful. You can remove the patina with a mixture of lemon juice and salt.\nQ3: Can I keep tea or coffee in my LivEasy Essentials Copper Bottle?\nAns: Tea, coffee or any beverage may alter the pH balance of the copper bottle or even react with it if the liquid is very hot.
